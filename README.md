**Deprecate** in favor of [vim-tabdrop](https://github.com/ipod825/vim-tabdrop)

Jumping with tags in vim is a pain if you are used to tabs. TagJump open a new tab (or go to the tab already opening the file, i.e. `tab drop` behavior) when you jump with tags. It also automatically close the tab when you jump back with `<C-t>`. This prevents you from creating duplicate tabs when you jump to the same file multiple times.
